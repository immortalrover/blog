## What is man?

`man` is a very efficient tool for developers that can help you solve all kinds of problems.
But many people, especially Chinese people, don't use it well.

One of the reasons is that it's all in English, and it takes some time to understand.

To become an expert with it, you need some basic knowledge of English, but after you have a certain level of English, just enjoy it for fun.

## How to use man

### Try your hand

Open your shell, quickly input the command.

```Shell
man man
```

You will see lots of English, but don't worry.
There's no need to understand these English.

Just try scrolling up or down with the mouse wheel, or swiping up or down on the touchpad.

Then press the `q` key on the keyborad.

Now you have gained a complete experience of using `man`. It's easy but powerful.

### Try a more efficient mode

Please throw away your mouse. Then input the command.

```Shell
man less
```

Please spend a few minutes reading it.
Try use some shortcuts.

To follow your reading speed, I recommend use the key `d` for forward and the key `b` for backward.

These shortcuts are very interesting.
They can significantly improve your reading efficiency.

### Try more

Go find some programs you like. Then `man` it!

> After downloading some programs, remember to update the mandb by `sudo mandb` or other commands. It can keep your shell's autocompletion up to date.

## Why use man

In fact, in the vast majority of cases, input `--help` can not solve your confusion.
They can only provide limited text which is not enough to fully understand how the program works.

And, basically, every developer will spend some effort to write man manual page but not `--help`.
So using `man` is the best communication bridge between you and the program's author.
