## What's Vim?

Actually, it doesn't need my introduction, as [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a very, very famous open-source software.
It is very lightweight and appears on almost every Linux system.
Countless programmers use it, resulting in a highly active community, and everything can be customized.

## How to use Vim

### Use and read it

It's essential to use vim to learn vim.

Open your vim.

```Shell
vim
```

type out

```vim
:help
```

or directly press `<F1>` on your keyborad.

### Other language

[Here](https://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/) are other languages for you to choose from.

Chinese users can find the Chinese version for download here.

## Why use Vim

That is the main theme of this blog post.

The vast majority of people use VSCode.
But Vim has advantages that VSCode cannot replace.

### Plugins

-   In VSCode, you need to find many plugins to accomplish coding tasks.
-   Sublime Text is excellent, but its community is too small.
-   But in Vim, you don't need as many plugins.
    You can directly call system programs, which can make your work much more efficient.
    And theoretically, using Vim enables you to perform more complex and astonishing operations.

> People only focus on plugins but overlook that writing code is the actual work.
> And they believe that finding a plugin is equivalent to putting effort into coding.

### Learning cost

-   VSCode has no learning cost, it's as easy to use as Notepad.
    So it can attract a large number of users.
    But this also results in a generally low level of programming proficiency among users.
-   Sublime Text has a learning curve, and you can enjoy using it on Windows for a while.
    But on Windows, Notepad is the best tool for writing code.ðŸ˜„
-   Vim has a certain learning curve, but it's not excessively high.
    It mainly depends on collaboration with the program authors to brainstorm the best coding mode.

> If you are delving into the world of Linux, then Vim is an indispensable tool for you.

### Use experience

-   VSCode offers a good user experience, provided you find some handy plugins.
-   Sublime Text offers a better coding experience than VSCode, but it's easier to encounter issues in unfamiliar territory, and troubleshooting can be quite cumbersome.
-   The coding experience in Vim gets better with continued use, which is something the other two can't match.

### My understanding

In reality, whether it's VSCode or Sublime Text, they are essentially tools. As you use them over time, your dissatisfaction may grow. At that point, if a "better" software emerges on the market, you might abandon them.

But Vim is different. Vim stands apart by guiding rather than dictating user actions, allowing for blue-sky thinking and extensive customization to create a unique personal editor.
By then, the author of Vim isn't just one person anymore, you created your own Vim.

> You're still young and have your own ideas. When choosing an editor, don't just focus on coding, consider the thoughts of the editor's creators more.
