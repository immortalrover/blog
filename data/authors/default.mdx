I am currently an undergraduate in Wuhan University. I have participated in several ACM algorithm competitions in the past and have been continuously learning the writing of project code, learning the use of new technologies, and studying mathematics and algorithms.

I'm eager to embrace new tech adventures and tackle unknown challenges with a steady heart, believing that eventually, true worth will gleam like gold.
