I am currently an undergraduate in Wuhan University. I have participated in several ACM algorithm competitions in the past and have been continuously learning the writing of project code, learning the use of new technologies, and studying mathematics and algorithms.

I'm eager to embrace new tech adventures and tackle unknown challenges with a steady heart, believing that eventually, true worth will gleam like gold.

If I hadn't encountered programming, my life would have remained stuck at that summer when I was 18.

## Timeline

### 2024

- Started learning frame programming, learned [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React.js](https://react.dev/learn), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).
- Learned [JavaScipt](https://javascript.info/).
- Relearned [Coq](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/).
- Rebuild blog using the web frame I currently learn. I will finish it perfectly.

### 2023

- Learned [C++](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb&feature=shared).
- Started participating in algorithm competitions and joined [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).
- Learned [Coq](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/), but it was in vain.
- Started learning Linux and learned to use [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) and [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/).
- Learned how to use [Vim](https://www.vim.org/).
  > It's quite evident that I've adopted Arch Linux as my primary operating system, significantly enhancing my programming efficiency. However, the disadvantage is that I've developed a dislike for using the mouse.
- Learned a little about Artificial Intelligence, but I don't have enough time to study it fully.
- Learned how to use [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
- Started learning how to build a blog, but I feel the blog website very bad, so I abandoned it.

### 2022

- Started an education as an undergraduate in [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/).
- Learned basic web programming, learned [HTML](https://youtu.be/nNFF_sib0Jc?feature=shared), [CSS](https://youtu.be/laEqXy9cjs0?feature=shared).
