## Editor

- I use [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) with some [configurations](https://github.com/immortalrover/dotfiles).
- I've tried VS Code and Sublime Text in the past, but they left me somewhat dissatisfied, more or less.

## Session

- I use [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/), which truly helps me get rid of using the mouse click.
- I've tried KDE plasma, but it feels similar to using the Windows OS.

## Desk Setup

- Laptop:
  - LEGION
- PC:
  - i9-13900KF + RTX 4090

## Keyboard

- The main keyboard I use is the thin membrane keyboard that came with my Lenovo computer.
- My alternative is [玄机科技鬼刀三模游戏机械键盘海琴烟款](https://b23.tv/EdxQc7w)
